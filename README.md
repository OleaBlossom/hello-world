# hello-world
my first repository
===================

So, uh, I'm new here.

And sometimes I don't stick with new things, so if this is old and dusty now, soz - I'm probs long gone.

If I'm still kicking around, that's awesome. You should check out how well I'm going with the Swift-learning, and say hi or offer some assistance or commiserations as the case may be.
